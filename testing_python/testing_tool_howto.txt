Use the following command in your terminal. It's best to run this from the same directory where your script is located.
python tester.py <your_script_name.py> <your_function_name> <your_test_directory>
In the test cases folder, it is expected that there are pairs of .in and .out files
.in files are the function parameters - each line being a parameter -  and will be fed into the function in line order
.out files represent the expected output, and are parsed the same way as the input
each line is read as JSON, and will be parsed as such
Example usage:
Test Script: my_solution.py
# my_solution.py
def add(a, b):
  # Your function takes two arguments, which are Python dictionaries in this case
  return a['x'] + b['x']

tests/test1.in
{"x": 5}
{"x": 10}

tests/test1.out
15

Run from Terminal:
python tester.py my_solution.py add test_cases/ 

Output(in terminal):
