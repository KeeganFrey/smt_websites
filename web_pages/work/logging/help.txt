## Website Ideas based on Physical Store Types

- **Sales & Customer Traffic Logger for Retail:** A tool for "department stores," "apparel" shops, or any retail outlet to log daily sales figures, customer foot traffic (if manually tracked or via sensors), and perhaps notes on promotions or events.
- **Restaurant Operations Log:** For "fast food," "diners," "cafes" to log daily opening/closing procedures, food safety checks, inventory spoilage, customer complaints/feedback, and maintenance issues.
- **Vehicle Maintenance & Repair Log (for businesses):** For companies managing a fleet of "automobiles" (e.g., delivery services linked to "pizza" or "groceries") or for "repair shops" themselves to log customer vehicle repair histories.
- **Farm Operations Log:** For "farmers markets" (the suppliers) or "farm stuff" retailers. Logging planting schedules, harvest yields, pest control measures, equipment maintenance.
- **Store Maintenance & Cleaning Schedule Logger:** A tool for any physical store ("ice cream" parlors, "hobby stores," "furniture" stores) to track and log cleaning schedules, equipment maintenance (e.g., for "fast coffee" machines), and repair requests.
